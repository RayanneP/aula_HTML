	<p style="font-size:25px; margin-left:230px; ">Take your eyes off of me so I can leave <br>
	I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me <br>
	This is never ending, we have been here before <br>
	But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore <br>
	Please, stay where you are <br>
	Don't come any closer <br>
	Don't try to change my mind <br>
	I'm being cruel to be kind <br>
	</p>

	<p style="font-size:25px; margin-left:230px; ">I can't love you in the dark <br>
	It feels like we're oceans apart <br>
	There is so much space between us <br>
	Baby, we're already defeated <br>
	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <br>
	Everything changed me <br>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:25px; margin-left:230px; ">You have given me something that I can't live without<br>
	You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt <br>
	But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine <br>
	The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight <br>
	Please, don't fall apart <br>
	I can't face your breaking heart <br>
	I'm trying to be brave <br>
	Stop asking me to stay <br>
	</p>
